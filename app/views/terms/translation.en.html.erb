        supply of Source Materials to Wisteria Web Solutions is made subject to
        these terms and conditions.</br>
        </br>
        No contract exists in respect of any request for translation services or
        in respect of any Source Materials that may be submitted to Wisteria Web
        Solution, unless and until there is an Accepted Quote. Once there is an

        </br>
        Wisteria Web Solutions reserves the right to decline to issue a Quote or
        to provide any translation services if the Source Materials contain any
        material which Wisteria Web Solutions at its discretion (and without any
        obligation on Wisteria Web Solutions to review the Source Materials for
        appropriateness, legality or otherwise) considers to be offensive,
        obscene, contrary to any law or otherwise considered by Wisteria Web
        Solution to be inappropriate.
      </p>
      <h2>4. Provision of Services</h2>
      <p>
        Subject to receipt of all applicable amounts due from the Client,
        Wisteria Web Solutions will provide the Services as specified in the
        Accepted Quote and in accordance Wisteria Web Solutions’ standard
        practices and procedures including the practices and procedures as
        described on the Website at the time the Quote was issued to the Client.</br>
        </br>
        The Client must provide all information requested by Wisteria Web
        Solution (via the Website) in respect of the Services and ensure that
        all such information is accurate and complete.</br>
        </br>
        Wisteria Web Solutions provides services at different specified quality
        levels. It is the Client’s responsibility to select the preferred level
        of service to suit its requirements. Wisteria Web Solutions will deliver
        to the selected level of service as specified in the Accepted Quote and
        has no obligation to check whether that quality level is appropriate for
        the Client’s needs.</br>
        </br>
        Wisteria Web Solutions has no responsibility to complete the translation
        for the price quoted if the word count and or nature of the translation
        varies from what was able to be gained from the Source Materials when
        first quoted.  Wisteria Web Solutions will provide the Client with a
        corrected quote with the difference owing for completion of the job and
        amended delivery date if necessary.  The Client may opt to instead
        receive a full refund if the correct quote is not acceptable.</br>
        </br>
        Should a Client purchase the translation services on a Sunday then it
        may result in a minor delay in the timeframe to complete.  Wisteria Web
        Solution will use its best endeavours to ensure this does not happen but
        will notify the Client as soon as practicably possible on a Monday
        identifying of any delay.</br>
        </br>
        Wisteria Web Solutions has no responsibility to review the quality of the
        Source Materials for typographical or any other errors and has no
        liability to review the Source Material for or to correct any errors or
        omissions contained in any Source Materials regardless of the nature of
        such errors or omissions and regardless of the impact that such errors
        or omissions may have on the quality of the Deliverables.</br>
        </br>
        On completion of the Services and subject to receipt by Wisteria Web
        Solution of all amounts due from the Client, Wisteria Web Solutions will
        issue the Deliverables to the Client.</br>
        </br>
        Wisteria Web Solutions will issue the Deliverables to the Client in
        accordance with Wisteria Web Solutions’ standard practices and
        procedures applicable at the time or as otherwise specified in the Quote.
        Wisteria Web Solutions will use reasonable endeavours to issue the
        Deliverables on or before the agreed delivery date / time, or where no
        specific delivery date/ time is agreed within a reasonable time
        following receipt of the Accepted Quote, but Wisteria Web Solutions
        accepts no liability for any delay in meeting the applicable timing.

          its use of the Website, the Services or otherwise in connection with

      <p>
        The Client may, without cause, terminate a Contract (or, subject to this

        first payment in respect of that Contract has been received by Wisteria
        Web Solutions, by giving written notification to Wisteria Web Solutions
        within that 30 minute time period. The Client may only terminate part of
        a Contract where separate pricing is specified in the Accepted Quote for
        the Services no longer required. Where a Contract is partially terminated
        under this clause, the Client must, at the time of giving notice of
        termination, specify the Services that are no longer required.</br>
        </br>
        Without limiting any other rights or remedies that Wisteria Web Solutions
        may have, Wisteria Web Solutions may terminate the Contract on written
        notice to the Client if the Client fails to pay any overdue amount within
        five days following written notice from Wisteria Web Solutions requiring
        payment.</br>
        </br>
        Without limiting Wisteria Web Solutions’s rights under clause 10.2,

      </p>
      <ol class="low-al">
        <li>breaches any of its obligations under the Contract and fails to

        <li>becomes insolvent or goes into liquidation or has a receiver or
          statutory manager appointed over its assets or ceases to carry on
          business or makes any arrangement with its creditors.</li></br>
      </ol>
      <p>
        On termination of a Contract:</br>
      <ol class="low-al">
        <li>any amounts due to Wisteria Web Solutions will become immediately
          due and payable;</li>
        <li>the provisions of the Contract that are by their nature intended to
          survive termination will remain in full force.</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <h2>13. Dispute resolution</h2>
      <p>
        Where any dispute arises between the parties concerning a Contract or
        the circumstances, representations, or conduct giving rise to the
        Contract, neither party may commence any court or arbitration proceedings
        relating to the dispute unless that party has complied with the
        procedures set out in this clause 12.</br>
        </br>
        The party initiating the dispute (“the first party”) must provide
        written notice of the dispute to the other party (“the other party”) and
        nominate in that notice the first party’s representative for the
        negotiations. The other party must within seven days of receipt of the
        notice, give written notice to the first party naming its representative
        for the negotiations. Each representative nominated will have authority
        to settle or resolve the dispute.</br>
        </br>
        If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute by discussion and
        negotiation within 14 days of receipt of the written notice from the
        first party, then the parties must immediately refer the dispute to
        mediation.</br>
        </br>
        The mediation must be conducted in terms of the LEADR New Zealand Inc
        Standard Mediation Agreement. The mediation must be conducted by a
        mediator at a fee agreed by the parties. Failing agreement between the
        parties, the mediator will be selected and his/her fee determined by the
        Chair for the time being of LEADR New Zealand Inc.
      </p>
      <h2>14. Consumer Guarantees Act</h2>
      <p>
        If the Client acquires, or holds itself out as acquiring, goods or
        services from Wisteria Web Solutions under a Contract for the purposes
        of a business, and the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 would apply were it
        not for this clause 13.1, the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 will not apply.
      </p>
      <h2>15. Validity of the Agreement</h2>
      <p>
        Either party may terminate the agreement on 7 working days’ written
        notice to the other party.</br>
        </br>
        Wisteria Web Solutions reserves the right to cease immediately without
        liability to provide the service and to terminate this agreement if you
        should go into liquidation or bankruptcy, or if you fail to meet any
        obligation in accordance with this agreement.</br>
        </br>
        If at any point during the Web marketing service, a client wishes to
        cancel, they may do so. In all circumstances, Wisteria Web Solutions
        will retain a minimum of 25% of the service fee and, in agreement with
        the client, will invoice above that amount proportional to the amount
        of work completed on the project.</br>
        </br>
        If an marketing strategy has been provided to the client, the full
        amount of the service is deemed payable. The strategy remains the
        property of Wisteria Web Solutions until such time that the client has
        paid the final 50% of the service amount.</br>
        </br>
        If it is agreed by both parties that if the amount of work completed is
        less than half of the service (and a strategy document has not provided)
        25% of the full service cost will be refunded.
      </p>

        though Wisteria Web Solutions may have been notified of such damage or
        claims.</br>
        </br>
        We shall not be liable to you for any loss or damage directly or
        indirectly arising out of or in connection with any delay in delivery of
        the goods or failure to perform its obligations under this agreement

        government, inability to obtain labour, materials or manufacturing
        facilities, accidents, interruptions of, or delay in, transportation or
        any other cause beyond our control.</br>
        </br>
        You agree to defend, indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any

        amount paid by the Client to Wisteria Web Solutions for the Services.</br>
        </br>

        for publication will be considered publicly accessible. Wisteria Web
        Solutions does not screen in advance customer material submitted to
        Wisteria Web Solutions for publication. Wisteria Web Solutions’
        publication of material submitted by customers does not create any
        express or implied approval by Wisteria Web Solutions of such material,
        nor does it indicate that such material complies with the terms of this
        agreement.
